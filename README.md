## Repo name:

## File containing R code for reading in datasets: 
index.Rmd

## Datasets contained in repo:
1. Social_Media_and_Mental_Health.csv - I found this file on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/souvikahmed071/social-media-and-mental-health/data). Data for this project was collected using a survey (482 responses) inquiring about social media use and mental health to determine if there is a correlation between the two. There are various demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, relationship status, occupation) as well as 15 survey item responses. 

2. UMassChan_ClerkshipGrades.xlsx - this is a dataset that I use in my current job at UMass Chan Medical School. Student names were removed and school IDs were replaced with random IDs. The file contains student subcomponent and final grades for 3rd year clinical rotations and includes five academic years of data (6,427 individual student rows). The dataset contains the following variables: ID, course name, location each student was at, numeric and letter grades for the 3 different subcomponents as well as the final course grade.  

3. I found the third dataset on a Los Angeles, CA open data website and it contains crime data from 2020 to present. I was able to export the entire dataset as a csv file however it contains 979,000 rows and is therefore too large to commit.  They also provide access to an API (https://data.lacity.org/resource/2nrs-mtv8.json) so I was also able to export a smaller subset of the data from there which I am able to commit.  This file contains 28 variables including crime date & time, geographic area, specific address, victim gender & age, description of the crime, whether a weapon was used, and latitude/longitude.
