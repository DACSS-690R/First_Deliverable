## File containing R code for reading in datasets: index.Rmd

## Datasets contained in repo:
1. Social_Media_and_Mental_Health.csv - I found this file on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/souvikahmed071/social-media-and-mental-health/data). Data for this project was collected using a survey (482 responses) inquiring about social media use and mental health to determine if there is a correlation between the two. There are various demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, relationship status, occupation) as well as 15 survey item responses. 

2. UMassChan_ClerkshipGrades.xlsx - this is a dataset that I use in my current job at UMass Chan Medical School. Student names were removed and school IDs were replaced with random IDs. The file contains student subcomponent and final grades for 3rd year clinical rotations and includes five academic years worth of data (6,427 individual student rows). The dataset contains the following variables in this dataset (ID, course name, location each student was at, numeric and letter grades for 3 different subcomponents and a final course grade (numeric and letter).  

3. I found a third dataset on the Los Angeles, CA open data website and it contains crime data from 2020 to present. I exported this dataset using their API (https://data.lacity.org/resource/2nrs-mtv8.json). The full dataset contains 28 variables and 979,000 rows, however when I export from the API there is a limit of 1000 rows.
